In order to establish an electronic structure of strongly correlated material, one can use a Dynamycal mean-field theory.
DMFT maps a lattice problem to a single site problem, in our case we transform a celebrated
Hubbard model to the Anderson impurity model, using so-called Dual-fermion approach. We then calculate the local properties
of this model, such as Green and vertex functions within imaginary time representation and corresponding Matsubara space.
