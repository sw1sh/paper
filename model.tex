\section{Model}
\subsection{Strongly correlated system}
Strongly correlated system is a class of materials, where the behavior of their electrons can't be 
described effectively in terms of non-interacting entities. Therefore models of the electronic
structure of strongly correlated system must include electronic correlation.

\subsection{The Hubbard model}
Having a lattice of atoms with electrons that are almost localized at each site with possibility to hop
only between nearest neighbors and approximation that electrons interact with each other only in a single orbit, 
the Hubbard model can be thus be written

\[ H = -t\sum_{i,j,\sigma}\left(c_{i,\sigma}^\dagger c_{j,\sigma} + H.c.  \right) + U\sum_i n_{i\uparrow}n_{i\downarrow}\]
